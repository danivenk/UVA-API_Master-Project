constraints on size scale of the diska and corona + geometry

Well studied in hard state
hard lags PL between PL energy bands studied with Ginga/Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
Myamoto et al 1988; Nowak et al 1999b; Grinberg et al 2014; Altaminaro & Méndez 2015

2 possible origins
compton scattering delays in an extended corona vs propagation delays in hot accretion flow

seed photons multiple upscatterings into higher energy
delays linked to light-travel times .1-10s large coronal size scale (10ks Rg)
energy requirements heating large spherical corona not possible
avoided Compton scattering in hard state jets
Rieg et al 2003; Giannios et al 2004; Kylafis et al 2008

large hard lags smaller scales in accretion flow. via propagation of mass accretion fluctuations
driving force of broad band noisevariability
Lyubarskii 1997; Uttley et al 2005
truncated disk, corona inner hot geometrically thick flow power-law hardening towards smaller radii
Kotev et al 2001; Arévalo & Uttley 2006
Lags produced by the propagation delays between radii
soft & hard emission decreasing for decreasing radii -> higher variability frequencies
energy dependence of the lag, variability power spectrum
discontinuities: emission spectrum (Rapisarda et al 2016; Mahmoud & Done 2018a), input variability signal (Mahmoud & Done 2018b), speed of propagation (Kawamura et al 2021)

soft band focus on BB disk hard state XMM-Newton data GX 339-4 Wilkinson & Uttley 2009
variability of minutes -> < 1s, strongest > 1s
Uttley et al 2011 <1Hz soft PL lag disk lag disk several times more thanhard PL lags at same frequencies
>1Hz roll overnegative soft lags disk delayed 1-2ms to soft PL
mass accretion fluctuations first propagate through disk before varying PL emissions of central corona
varying coronal emissions illuminates & reprocessed in the disk soft "reverberation" signal light travel delays few 10s of Rg
Mastroserio et al 2018; Mahmout et al 2019
reverberation confirmed with NICER
fourier frequencies of enhanced delays broadened iron Ka reflection
Kara et al 2019

Soft lags different luminosities
De Marco et al 2015, 2017
light travel delays 100s Rg/c low accretion rates suggesting large radii truncation
luminous black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 (Kara et al 2019; De Marco et al 2021; Wang et al 2021)
different sources using NICER Wang et al 2022
reveals pattern soft lags decrease to <1ms hard state rise and then sharply increase >10ms transition HIMS->SIMS
sharp rise in soft reverberation lags during HIMS disk close to ISCO
corona more vertically extended and jet-like
Kara et al 2019; De Marco et al 2021; Wang et al 2022
Relativistic jet ejections during state transition Homan et al 2020; Wang et al 2021

progragress has been made studying hard and soft lags
evolution of lags important info on disk corona geometry origin of different accretion states
understanding of origin of lags between physical components on different time-scales of variability
individual models can explain seperately none can do altogether
comptonization delay model require extremely extended coronae in hard state >10^3Rg
inconsistent with reverberation delays inferred from soft lags
large PL-disk lags at low frequencies further increase discrepancy if light travel delays between the disk seed photons and corona (Uttley et al 2011)
low frequency PL disk model via propagation of fluctuaions through the disk are inconsistent with hot flow propagation models for hard lags over same frequency range
tension between hard PL lag models and models for lags including disk photons (hard & soft)

resolve tension
propagating fluctuations model for lags explain all hard disk PL lags low frequencies and soft lags at high frequencies
link to coronal geometry
observed features are natural consequence variations of seed photons illuminate the corona as accretion fluctuations propagate through disk to corona
seed photons are modulated by fluctuations before corona is heated by them
coroona cools and heats after large viscous time scale delay 
produce large hard PL lags for small coronae and inner disk radii

negative soft lags lags result from reverberation responding after somwhat slow rise in seed photons as fluctations propagate through inner regions of disk
increase both hard PLlags and PL-disk negative lags can be explained by changes in coronal geometry
more vertically extended coronae respond to seed variations from further out in disk -> larger lags
lags predicted by model including soft lags are linked to propagation delays not light travel times
corona are much more compact than implied by comptonisation or reverberation light travel delay models
type of geometrical change inferred more vertically extended in HIMS simsilar
